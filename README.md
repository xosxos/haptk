## How to install
```bash

# Install Rust and the Cargo package manager
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# The Rust binaries directory is added automatically to the shells $PATH variable when it is restarted
# If you face problems, add the directory to the $PATH variable.
# For example for `bash` or `zsh`, run this line:
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
# For `fish` shell, use this command:
fish_add_path "$HOME/.cargo/bin"

# Make sure cmake is installed
# It is available in all common package managers such as apt, dnf, brew

# Install HAPTK using cargo (recommended), or download a binary from the releases page
cargo install haptk --locked

# Install the python graph library using anaconda or micromamba (environment.yml is located at the github root directory)
micromamba env create -f environment.yml
micromamba activate haptk

# OR by running pip. Using python 3.12 is highly recommended.
pip install haptk
```


## Example
A common requirement is to select only certain alleles of the samples based on a condition, this is done with the `--alleles` argument.
Options:
- `all` (default) [Select all alleles (diploid genomes)]
- `only-refs` [Select only the samples carrying the REF variant at the coordinate]
- `only-alts` [Select only the samples carrying the ALT variant at the coordinate]
- `longest-haplotype` [Select only the allele per each sample sharing the most haplotype with the haplotypes of the other samples]

```bash

# Go into the examples directory
cd examples

# Index the file
bcftools index -t 1kGP_high_coverage_Illumina.chr9.filtered.SNV_INDEL_SV_phased_panel.biallelic.vcf.gz
 
# Create unidirectional HSTs of the 1kg samples
haptk uhst 1kGP_high_coverage_Illumina.chr9.filtered.SNV_INDEL_SV_phased_panel.biallelic.vcf.gz \
  --alleles all \
  --samples 1kGP_high_coverage_Illumina.finnish.ids 1kGP_high_coverage_Illumina.gambian.ids 1kGP_high_coverage_Illumina.han_chinese.ids \
  --coords chr9:27573534 \
  -t 8 \
  -o results

```

Visualize the HST using the HAPTK Python library
```python
import haptk

def read_samples(filename):
  with open(filename) as file:
      lines = [line.rstrip() for line in file]
      return lines

# The IDs are located in the examples directory
gambian = read_samples("1kGP_high_coverage_Illumina.gambian.ids")
finnish = read_samples("1kGP_high_coverage_Illumina.finnish.ids")
han_chinese = read_samples("1kGP_high_coverage_Illumina.han_chinese.ids")

hst = haptk.read_hst("results/uhst_left.hst.gz")

hst.circle_tree("my_left_hst.png", to_tag=[gambian, finnish, han_chinese], colors=["red", "blue", "green"])
```

The HST starting from chr9:27573534 tagged for Gambian (red), Finnish (blue) and Han Chinese (green) ancestry

### Bidirectional haplotype sharing tree (bHST) with tagged samples
A Finnish C9orf72 expansion carrier bHST with FTD cases tagged in green and ALS cases tagged in red.

### Haplotype comparison graph
All the samples are compared to a haplotype, in this case the C9orf72 expansion ancestral haplotype.
The matching variants are colored in white (or blue) and deviating variants in pink.
Because the actual sample haplotypes are seen in relation to the ancestral haplotype, potential switch and genotyping errors can be evaluated from this graph.
The selection of C9orf72 haplotypes is done by discarding the haplotypes tagged in blue (the ones sharing less ancestral haplotype sequence per sample).
